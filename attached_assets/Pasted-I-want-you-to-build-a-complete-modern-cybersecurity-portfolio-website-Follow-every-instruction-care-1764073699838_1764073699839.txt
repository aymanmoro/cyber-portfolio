I want you to build a complete modern cybersecurity portfolio website.
Follow every instruction carefully and generate the full project (HTML, CSS, JS, API routes if needed), with clean file structure and modern code.
This portfolio must be dynamic, interactive, animated, and visually stunning.
Below are the specifications.
DO NOT simplify. Build it like a premium site for a top cybersecurity engineer.
⚡ 1. PROJECT TYPE

A fully dynamic, interactive cybersecurity-themed portfolio, built with:

Frontend: HTML + CSS + Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

Optional but encouraged: React or Next.js if you judge it will produce a better result

Canvas & WebGL animations for visual effects

Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Light/dark mode theme

Multi-language system (FR/EN)

⚡ 2. THEME & STYLE

The design must be:

Futuristic, cyberpunk, neon, dark mode

Inspired by: HackTheBox, TryHackMe, NASA, Cyberpunk 2077 UI, Space/Astro themes

Animated background (nebula, particles, map, network graph, matrix rain, or nodes connected)

Smooth transitions, parallax, hover interactions, scroll animations

Use gradients, glowing borders, blurred glass (glassmorphism)

⚡ 3. SECTIONS TO INCLUDE

Build ALL these sections with polished UI:

⭐ HERO SECTION

My name: Ayman Mourtada

Animated typing / glitch text

Animated cyber map or interactive background

Buttons: "Projects", "Contact"

⭐ ABOUT

Short bio
Key facts (location, skills focus, availability)

⭐ EXPERIENCE TIMELINE

CTF achievements

Internships

Engineering studies

Cybersecurity projects

Use a dynamic vertical timeline with animations.

⭐ PROJECTS GALLERY

6+ cards with:
